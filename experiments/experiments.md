### Experiment Four ###

Using a Transistor to Drive a Motor

Here is the fan sequence whilst running. 

#### Reflection ####

For this particular experiment it made grasping the concept of sequencial coding make sense for me. As in, a start loop will always preceed any other loop and whatever is in the forever loop will execute in the exact order given. Meaning that while conceptually you (the coder) separate tasks into individual items or inputs in your mind, whereas the microbit code only takes exactly what you give it.

This experiment could be the basis of a real world application such as any automated system, including desk, ceiling or computer fans.

### Experiment 7 ###

Wind Power

In the code below, replace imagemissing.jpg with the name of the image, which should be in the kitexperiments folder.

This picture shows the completed Wind Power experiment whilst not in motion.

#### Reflection ####

This experiment was a great example of showing how the pins on the microbit can function as both outputs and inputs.

This experiment could be the basis of a real world application such as a breath controller/measuring device.

### Experiment 8 ###

Making a Game using the Compass

#### Photo of completed project ####
In the code below, replace imagemissing.jpg with the name of the image, which should be in the kitexperiments folder.

![Compass](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62095800/76947944-16dc6a00-6952-11ea-9d2d-6cbe7893237d.jpg)

The compass experiment here is in mid-flash of the LED.

#### Reflection ####

I found this experiment to be helpful in learning about how simple a conceptual model can be and still be successful. The premise and controls are very simplistic but that is, in part, what makes it successful as a 'game' or product.

This experiment could be the basis of a real world application such as a digital compass or children's toy.

### Experiment 11 ###

Making a Pedestrian Crossing

#### Photo of completed project ####
In the code below, replace imagemissing.jpg with the name of the image, which should be in the kitexperiments folder.

This pedestrian crossing shows its initial stage. 

#### Reflection ####

In this experiment, something new to me was or something I learned was the sometimes tedius work you must do for straight sequencing without randomness or qualifying statements.

 A real world adaption of this experiment could be an actual traffic light and pedestrian crossing, a children's toy or a         visual and auditory sign of decontamination or clearance.

### Experiment 12 ###

Making a Randomising Dice Roll

#### Photo of completed project ####
In the code below, replace imagemissing.jpg with the name of the image, which should be in the kitexperiments folder.

![Dice](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62095800/76947977-25c31c80-6952-11ea-9720-0068bfe2242d.jpg)

This is an answer of six on the randomising digital dice roller.

#### Reflection ####

In this experiment, I really enjoyed taking the experiment as it was and expanding on it. In doing so, I learned about analysing the original code and seeing what I could change and where it would function the best. For this experiment I added a 'rolling' sequence that is some sort of feedback and fun interaction for the user that clearly differentiates from 'previous answer' to 'new answer'. 

This experiment could be the basis of a real world application such as a digital dice.
