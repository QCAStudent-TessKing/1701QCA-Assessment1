This product serves as the inspiration for the aesthetics as well as some parts of the functional design such as the key and slider mechanics. However, due some material and process restrictions, the original mechanics had to be adapted to be suitable for use with the microbit. 

### Makecode Microbit - Guitar ###
It's more like a theremin, but at least it looks like a guitar!

The microbit guitar project presents some interesting concepts and explains well enough how to utilise some on board features like the light level sensor built into the microbit screen. I employed this demonstration as a way to add some versatility and variety to my own project. 
 
### John Ferguson - Spike of Noise ###
A touchable jumble of spikes that, on occassion, make noise.

I was inspired by the simplistic approach to interactivity on display here. Simple conductive material covers certain areas of the spikes which allow for the user's body to close the circuit between points. 

### Anders Lind - LINES ###
There are lines going in all dimensions.

While this example may be a little too far in the realm of impossibility for my project I felt inspired by the simplicity of the conceptual model. However complicated the actual working of this installation, the conceptual model is very similar to my project in that the action of touching a line (in some capacity) results in a sound being played. 


### Piano Stairs ###
Created originally by Volkswagen in the Odenplan subway station to encourage people to use the stairs.

This is another wonderful example of a simple concept coming together cohesively and achieves a goal well. 

### Coplay ###
Designed and created by Haoyi Xu and Sun Yuxuan to explore the outer constraints of music composition methodology.

## Reading reflections ##
*Reflective reading is an important part of actually making your reading worthwhile. Don't just read the words to understand what they say: read to see how the ideas in the text fit with and potentially change your existing knowledge and maybe even conceptual frameworks. We assume you can basically figure out what the readings mean, but the more important process is to understand how that changes what you think, particularly in the context of your project.*

*For each of the assigned readings, answer the questions below.*

### Reading: Don Norman, The Design of Everyday Things, Chapter 1 (The Psychopathology of Everyday Things) ###

I had previously thought that signifiers and affordances were the same in many cases. Whilst reading I realised that I had thought that conceptual models weren't as important as they are for successful discoverability. 

In reading, I learned about how to go about analysing design in a much more profound sense; looking at the intertwining concepts that cause myself great annoyance or satisfaction in my daily life. Further, in analysing the world around my interations I began to see how designs could be improved for the sake of a user. Having made some interactive projects in the past, I found that I could see it from more of a technical angle about why it was successful in some areas and lacking in others. I found the challenge of "redesigning" a project in a new and interesting light from this and implemented the same concepts and analysis to the creation process. 

Personally, after reading this excerpt I felt even more interested by feedback systems. Especially non-verbal feedback systems. Having a background in music technology, I often compared the designs of electronic instruments, synthesizers, controllers and acoustic instruments like the clarinet or cello. The relationship between instrument and player is heavily dependant on the communications between them and when it comes to sound, much is communicated through haptic feedback. This being kinesthetic communication predominately felt as vibration. The player parses these vibrations as a response based on an inital command. The instrument communicates back to you which creates an intelligible relationship unique to each instrument and player.

As stated previously, this particular reading profoundly influenced the creation process in all stages. As I went through the original makecode banana piano project I felt that it could be improved utilising the principles Normal taught. When it came to design, a traditional piano layout seemed both the most appropriate and already laden with understanding of the conceptual model: press key --> sound plays, pitch increases left to right in keys. Using the design of the Nintedo Labo meant that I could keep the same and expected gesture of the note becoming depressed once pressed, even if it did nothing functionally. It served to allow the user to understand that their inherent expectation was not to be subverted and thus avoid a negative emotive response to that cognitive subversion. I applied this thought processes to the solutions I had to engineer throughout the physical and code based manufactoring stages as well.

### Reading: Chapter 1 of Dan Saffer, Microinteractions: Designing with Details, Chapter 1 ###

I previously thought not about microinteractions in this particular way but more in terms of their role in the larger elements. I also never thought of them with such definition as Saffer describes.

Saffer completely adjusted my philosophy towards design and products. I can now better communicate my analyses of the world around me and, similar to Norman, more accurately dissect stimulus. I especially found his thoughts on the mentalities you can take with microinteractions eye-opening. For instance, unrelatedly I read a paper on the invention of the Walkman. In it, the author claims that its invention was, "a regressive product of invention..." But, looking at how Saffer argues about microinteractions, it is clear that while the Walkman does functionally have fewer features than the boombox at the time, it focussed on a single feature and redesigned a product around a microinteraction. Here, the Walkman's simplistic focus on a sole interaction is what led to massive success. I've found that the design of such, and further expansion, integrates all of Saffer's philosophical principles. 

As I have an interest in holistic philosophy I found his thoughts on methodology interesting. Particularly his thought about ensuring that your product is a harmonious working of microinteractions. This is the type of mentality that I wish to adopt into my creative processes. Of which I began with the replication project. 

Applying the methodology and terminology to this project was profoundly useful in testing the concept model as a cohesive whole. When drawing up what could be interacted with, to what result and design, I frequenctly broke down the product as a whole to view the individual microinteractions then brought it back together to feel out how harmonious the integration was. If nothing else, it was a fantastic exerice in careful and deliberate design choices. 

### Reading: Scott Sullivan, Prototyping Interactive Objects ###

I found through reading that I had always assumed that getting to a pitchable prototyle was for professionals alone and that every iteration was only a proof of concept and material test, nothing more. 

Throughout the reading I realised that while the possibilities are "endless" for solutions to needs and goals, the solution you come to is only hindered by what you conceptually know exists as a designer. Which is why Sullivan doesn't specifically state what subsidary skills/knowledge a prototyping designer should look into. Everthing could be useful and will influence how you approach a problem, or even the means of function to a solution. Even so, if a designer comes up with a solution that they don't know the means to, google and friends are fantastic enlighteners.

This reading reignited my interest in project creation for the sake of it. I previously made an interactive electronic music controller/instrument and had a very similar experience to Sullivan. Not knowing anything about circuitry or electronics except that water may or may not be a wise decision. I found the experience challenging but also exhilarating because the design was my own and I could decide how far I wanted to reach into the realm of polished product. While that project was 'forced' upon me, I feel as though forcing myself into a problem to reach a satisfying solution is, as Sullivan learned, an excellent way to feel great about small victories and learn experiencially about everything surrounding the problem. 

There were many times during the production of my project where something went very differently to what was expected or just refused to work at all. During those times, I learned about the wonderful world of troubleshooting, an important step/s of the prototyping process.


## Interaction flowchart ##
*Draw a flowchart of the interaction process in your project. Make sure you think about all the stages of interaction step-by-step. Also make sure that you consider actions a user might take that aren't what you intend in an ideal use case. Insert an image of it below. It might just be a photo of a hand-drawn sketch, not a carefully drawn digital diagram. It just needs to be legible.*

## "Kind-A-Works" Piano ##


### Project description ###

This project is designed to be a completely portable, wireless musical instrument for impromptu jams by yourself or with friends. It has a five note layout and is tuned to a 'C' pentatonic scale with revived analogue character and fuzz. Light permitting, you can take advantage of the on board pitch modulation using the sliding tab on the left side of the housing. In bright light, the pitches are an octave higher than in low light. The sliding tab allows for the pitch to smoothly glissando down to the lower octave.

### Showcase image ###

*Try to capture the image as if it were in a portfolio, sales material, or project proposal. The project isn't likely to be something that finished, but practice making images that capture the project in that style.*

### Reflection ###

In terms of my original goals I believe that I was somewhat successful. I got the general idea of the expansions I wanted to make across and I believe it works "kind of" well as a cohesive unit on its own. However, I know that there is plenty of room fro improviement in all areas. As far as improvement of physical outcome, I think that the base interactions work as is and only require more precise and sturdy manufactoring for refinement. Refining and improving on the musical outcome would greatly improve the ultimate success of the product for me. This was a result of a lack of conceptual knowledge as to how the microbit code understood and wrote language. I had a preconceived idea as how to get to what I wanted and that greatly limited how I was able problem solve the issues I came across. I think that if I rethought about how the microbit understands things and what physical pins it is limited by I could reengineer a far better outcome with potentially no changes to the conceptual model. Additionally, due to my lack of comprehensive understanding of the coding language and microcontroller, areas of the design that would've improved feedback and user experience were eventually tossed out. For example, I had thought that while a speaker that plays the note pressed is an immediate form of feedback, if a speaker wire came loose (which was often) the user would then receive no feedback at all that the depression of the key was doing anything and would cause a negative emotive response (my roomate confirmed this hypothesis of mine). So, I thought of connecting LEDs into the system so that the user would be given visual feedback as, if nothing else, a backup response to the speaker wires coming loose. However, the testing I performed including multiple LEDs and keys taking up separate pins resulted in errors that were due to the pin assignments in microbit. It is only after completing some other stages of testing and research did I find that I probably could've still used LEDs, just thought a little more laterally about how to efficiently use the pins that were the most effective. It was because I had a different conceptual model of how the i/o and code worked that I gave up on some features. 
This point ties into another area of improvement to be made: process. I feel that the process I chose to adopt meant that didn't keep focus on the problem but more of the solution. While this may sound like a fine process (I thought so too) I realised in the late stages of manufactoring that I was so fixed on the idea of making a completely DIY "Nintendo Labo" style piano that I forgot about how I was going to get there technically and what the problem originally was. For me, the banana piano lacked versatility in its functionality. There was no control over what type of sound played, how long, how loud, what pitch etc. In focussing on the idea of a cardboard keyboard I neglected those issues and made a less versatile product. 

But the good news is that it means there is room for improvement!


I really wished that I had taken more of the advice and lessons from reading about Sullivan's work and implemented them here. His earnest but slightly haphazard methods for prototyping gave me plenty of inspiration and guidance whilst reading them, but I feel as though I didn't follow through on many of his points when it came to reality. Especially when it came to google and friends. I didn't seek help enough throughout the times when I needed to because I felt that I needed to find the solution myself otherwise I wouldn't learn anything. When it comes to troubleshooting and especially temperamental electronics, it is infinitely more wise to seek a human in person than google because while google may be right sometime, your friend can at least share your frustration and you can problem solve it together. 


The Nintendo Labo was incredible to me when it first came out, the concept as well as the seemingly magical workings of it all drew me in. I looked into how they made everything work with two little controllers and some reflective stickers and was in awe. I would say that the Labo was the most influencial idea for my project. As said previously, I've completed an interactive project prior to this which informed much of how I thought about code, building and design. While that project was more heavily centered around the musicality outcomes, I took a lot of realworld and conceptual knowledge and philosophy away from the experience. More specifically, we worked by programming with Pure Data (https://puredata.info/) which is open source software that is favoured for building sound design from the ground up and university students. It is an entirely visual means of programming but far more conceptually open than makecode for microbit. While it is freeing to use such versatile programming, makecode varies widely from Pd to the point that I had to adjust my means of thinking for it to make sense, but nonetheless I was heavily informed by what I learned in Pd.


An interesting expansion would be to make the simplistic model into a large scale interactive piece for multiple people to get involved with. In which, each member of this 'orchestra' has their own small piece of a giant synthesiser. Say that one person had an oscillator tone as a "note" or "block" and another had a modifying "block" that could change the pitch or timbre of the oscillator. Allowing for collaboration and mischief all in one interactive synthesiser. In this context, the instrument is being broken down into functional components that teach through experientation how a synthesiser works and some basic sonic and electronic principles.
