### Nintendo Labo ###

*Piano?*

This product serves as the inspiration for the aesthetics as well as some parts of the functional design such as the key and slider mechanics. However, due some material and process restrictions, the original mechanics had to be adapted to be suitable for use with the microbit. 

### Makecode Microbit - Guitar ###

*It's more like a Theremin, but at least it looks like a guitar!*

The microbit guitar project presents some interesting concepts and explains well enough how to utilise some on board features like the light level sensor built into the microbit screen. I employed this demonstration as a way to add some versatility and variety to my own project. 
 
### John Ferguson - Spike of Noise ###

*A touchable jumble of spikes that, on occasion, make noise.*

I was inspired by the simplistic approach to interactivity on display here. Simple conductive material covers certain areas of the spikes which allow for the user's body to close the circuit between points. 

### Anders Lind - LINES ###

*There are lines going in all dimensions.*

While this example may be a little too far in the realm of impossibility for my project, I felt inspired by the simplicity of the conceptual model. However complicated the actual working of this installation, the conceptual model is very similar to my project in that the action of touching a line (in some capacity) results in a sound being played. 


### Piano Stairs ###

*Created originally by Volkswagen in the Odenplan subway station to encourage people to use the stairs.*

This is another wonderful example of a simple concept coming together cohesively and achieves a goal well. 

### Coplay ###

*Designed and created by Haoyi Xu and Sun Yuxuan to explore the outer constraints of music composition methodology.*

I appreciate the specific goal of this installation. It states its intentions concretely and boldly strives for that mark. It challenges perceptions among a set audience and keeps the concept simple.


## Reading reflections ##


### Reading: Don Norman, The Design of Everyday Things, Chapter 1 (The Psychopathology of Everyday Things) ###

I had previously thought that signifiers and affordances were the same in many cases. Whilst reading I realised that I had thought that conceptual models weren't as important as they are for successful discoverability. 

In reading, I learned about how to go about analysing design in a much more profound sense; looking at the intertwining concepts that cause myself great annoyance or satisfaction in my daily life. Further, in analysing the world around my interactions, I began to see how designs could be improved for the sake of a user. Having made some interactive projects in the past, I found that I could see it from more of a technical angle about why it was successful in some areas and lacking in others. I found the challenge of "redesigning" a project in a new and interesting light from this and implemented the same concepts and analysis to the creation process. 

Personally, after reading this excerpt I felt even more interested by feedback systems. Especially non-verbal feedback systems. Having a background in music technology, I often compared the designs of electronic instruments, synthesizers, controllers and acoustic instruments like the clarinet or cello. The relationship between instrument and player is heavily dependent on the communications between them and when it comes to sound, much is communicated through haptic feedback. This being kinaesthetic communication predominately felt as vibration. The player parses these vibrations as a response based on an initial command. The instrument communicates back to you which creates an intelligible relationship unique to each instrument and player.

As stated previously, this reading profoundly influenced the creation process in all stages. As I went through the original makecode banana piano project I felt that it could be improved utilising the principles Normal taught. When it came to design, a traditional piano layout seemed both the most appropriate and already laden with understanding of the conceptual model: press key --> sound plays, pitch increases left to right in keys. Using the design of the Nintedo Labo meant that I could keep the same and expected gesture of the note becoming depressed once pressed, even if it did nothing functionally. It served to allow the user to understand that their inherent expectation was not to be subverted and thus avoid a negative emotive response to that cognitive subversion. I applied this thought processes to the solutions I had to engineer throughout the physical and code based manufacturing stages as well.

### Reading: Chapter 1 of Dan Saffer, Microinteractions: Designing with Details, Chapter 1 ###

I previously thought not about microinteractions in this way but more in terms of their role in the larger elements. I also never thought of them with such definition as Saffer describes.

Saffer completely adjusted my philosophy towards design and products. I can now better communicate my analyses of the world around me and, like Norman, more accurately dissect stimulus. I especially found his thoughts on the mentalities you can take with microinteractions eye-opening. For instance, unrelatedly I read a paper on the invention of the Walkman. In it, the author claims that its invention was, "a regressive product of invention..." But, looking at how Saffer argues about microinteractions, while the Walkman does functionally have fewer features than the boombox at the time, it focussed on a single feature and redesigned a product around a microinteraction. Here, the Walkman's simplistic focus on a sole interaction is what led to massive success. I've found that the design of such, and further expansion, integrates all Saffer's philosophical principles. 

As I have an interest in holistic philosophy, I found his thoughts on methodology interesting. Particularly his thought about ensuring that your product is a harmonious working of microinteractions. This is the type of mentality that I wish to adopt into my creative processes. Of which I began with the replication project. 

Applying the methodology and terminology to this project was profoundly useful in testing the concept model as a cohesive whole. When drawing up what could be interacted with, to what result and design, I frequently broke down the product to view the individual microinteractions then brought it back together to feel out how harmonious the integration was. If nothing else, it was a fantastic exercise in careful and deliberate design choices. 

### Reading: Scott Sullivan, Prototyping Interactive Objects ###

I found through reading that I had always assumed that getting to a pitchable prototype was for professionals alone and that every iteration was only a proof of concept and material test, nothing more. 

Throughout the reading I realised that while the possibilities are "endless" for solutions to needs and goals, the solution you come to is only hindered by what you conceptually know exists as a designer. Which is why Sullivan doesn't specifically state what subsidiary skills/knowledge a prototyping designer should investigate. Everything could be useful and will influence how you approach a problem, or even the means of function to a solution. Even so, if a designer comes up with a solution that they don't know the means to, google and friends are fantastic enlighteners.

This reading reignited my interest in project creation for the sake of it. I previously made an interactive electronic music controller/instrument and had a very similar experience to Sullivan. Not knowing anything about circuitry or electronics except that water may or may not be a wise decision. I found the experience challenging but also exhilarating because the design was my own and I could decide how far I wanted to reach into the realm of polished product. While that project was 'forced' upon me, I feel as though forcing myself into a problem to reach a satisfying solution is, as Sullivan learned, an excellent way to feel great about small victories and learn experientially about everything surrounding the problem. 

There were many times during the production of my project where something went very differently to what was expected or just refused to work at all. During those times, I learned about the wonderful world of troubleshooting, an important step/s of the prototyping process.

## Process documentation

### Conceptualisations ###

#### First Thoughts ####

![Original Thoughts](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62095800/77817923-3d509100-711a-11ea-9489-e5809b03db1d.jpg)

*This was what I wrote in response to completing the banana piano for the first time. I wanted the thoughts that were fresh to see what I should focus on in terms of expansion and improvement*

#### First Sketches ####

![Original Designs 1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62095800/77817928-3fb2eb00-711a-11ea-9fc3-8d6bf8f24957.jpg)

*Prior to any physical modelling or crafting, I drew up some ideas as to what it could look like and why. Please forgive my lack of talent in these drawings, a sense of spatialisation is not a character trait of mine. You can see that in the top right the pivoting key idea in its early stages with possibilities for how to "press" the pin with the action. Unlike my final iteration, the picture of housing was a little different here. I wanted to solve the issue of controlling light level in a purely mechanical way because I felt that it was unnecessary to find a digital/pin solution. In this idea, I would rely on gravity to keep the neutral position of the cover for the microbit face by making an angle that would also serve to put the microbit face closer into comfortable visual range.

#### Sketch in Further Detail ####

![Original Designs 2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62095800/77817931-42154500-711a-11ea-8317-bbaba4a02c30.jpg)

*Here the mechanism for controlling light level is pursued in further detail.*


### Construction Process ###


#### First Steps ####

![Construction 1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62095800/77817898-11351000-711a-11ea-9c2f-14909590d085.jpg)

*This is simply the main housing pieces after being laser cut. These would be the only pieces laser cut and as we will find out later, I wish this was not the case, I cannot rule nor cut in a straight line. I decided against the angled housing, since I did not know how to go about flattening that 3D shape into a 2D net with fold lines and such.*

#### First Assemblage ####

![Construction 2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62095800/77818814-6a547200-7121-11ea-9b4a-17870a04a0b9.jpg)

*This is after the basic, and somewhat painstaking, assemblage of the laser cut housing. Additionally, I have cut and assembled the light control mechanism and the first key. Unlike in the first sketches, the mechanism was not separate parts due to the inconsistency of pushing  a piece of cardboard with another on a flat surface. My solution was to cut out a piece of cardboard that had the sliding tab on one end, and a blob shape on the other end ( Cut down in areas later to suit the space) with small pieces glued to the parts immediately outside and inside of the hole to avoid sliding. The key kept to the sketches, but weight needed to be added to allow it to balance properly on the thin piece of cardboard it sat on.*

#### All Keys Made ####

![Construction 3](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62095800/77817902-15612d80-711a-11ea-84bf-76bc479b6c32.jpg)

*Here, the other four keys have finished being cut, put together and fitted into the housing*

#### Testing Mechanical Functions - Keys ####

![Construction 4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62095800/77817903-15f9c400-711a-11ea-89f7-9b6960f277c6.jpg)

*This is at the same point of completion but shows a simple test of the mechanical functionality. After some iterations of adding blu-tack in different places and of different amounts, I came to a successful result.*

#### Testing Mechanical Functions - Slider ####

![Construction 5](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62095800/77817907-1b570e80-711a-11ea-94df-db193deeea2e.jpg)

*This time I was testing the feel of the sliding mechanism. I, too, was pleased with this result at this stage.*

#### An Issue Arises ####

![Testing 1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62095800/77820479-55caa680-712e-11ea-8ccc-af66e76b2b28.jpg)

*Here I encountered my first real problem. I had always thought that in order to trigger the pin to play the note I would simply touch a piece of aluminium foil on the key itself, but some testing found a flaw here. In the banana piano project, they used pin and ground in separate interactions to complete the circuit if you pressed both simultaneously. No matter what I did, this would never produce the same result with aluminium foil and my hands. When I tested it with the 3V it worked, so I decided to go with what worked unquestionably. This still left the problem of how to get one interaction to cause two "plates" of aluminium foil to make contact. This image was taken at the moment I realised I needed to make some modifications.*

#### Assembled, Wired and Problem Solved ####

![Construction 6](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62095800/77817908-1f832c00-711a-11ea-8c9e-17b20fcccaa2.jpg)

*The problem is solved! This stage is quite a way after the testing process and several improvements have been made. The most joyous of improvements is that I have a functioning mechanism for the depressing of a key to close the circuit. My solution was to utilise the functionality I had already built into my design: the tilting action of the keys. If I assumed that the neutral position of the keys was to be flat, once engaged the front end would obviously tilt down and the back end would tilt up. Here I had two choices, make contact from the front end of the key to the bottom of the housing or make the back end contact the 'roof' of the housing. I chose the latter to keep the 'magical' aesthetic continuous throughout the design and because it was easier to attach an extension to the roof than figure it out on the bottom. I found that the end edge wasn't enough surface area to guarantee solid contact with the aluminium foil attached to the extended roof. So, I used small squares attached to that back edge, covered in aluminium foil to create the surface area that I needed. I also left the squares somewhat flexible so that they would press against the roof and become flat with it, ensuring contact. With that solution I moved onto wiring everything together for some more testing, which was somewhat interesting with aluminium foil.*

### Code ###


#### Code Testing 1 ####

![Code Iteration 1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62095800/77817940-4e999d80-711a-11ea-8759-5f494c6e39f8.jpg)

*This was my original statement for one pin that was copied for the other pins to test that contact would equal to a desired note. This didn't turn out as such, my best guesses were that I was using pins that were tied to other functions and confusing the microbit when asked to read their values and that the rest function wasn't isolated to that singular if statement; that it was reading 1 for, say, the 2nd pin but getting confused because the 1st pin in the chain wasn't reading above 0 and prioritising what came first. I will say however, that this code worked perfectly during the online simulations with multiple pins.* 

#### Code Testing 2 #### 

![Code Iteration 2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62095800/77817941-4fcaca80-711a-11ea-8690-53d7cf2860d2.jpg)

*I included this attempt to fix the problem to show the wonders of troubleshooting. I started with what my first thought to the issue was, it wasn't that, so I began thinking about how microbit parses what I program it to and thought that maybe it was getting confused because the 'rest' function was specifically for musical functions and all of the 'ring tones' are musical. This didn't solve my issue, hence why I looked through the signal chain for a more reasonable answer. A learned lesson.*

#### Final Code ####

![Final Code](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62095800/77817938-4d687080-711a-11ea-80cf-21dfc6aca5ca.png)

*After much testing and failures, I arrived at this conclusive code, which (mostly) solved all of my code-related problems. I decided that an extended 'if else' statement was far simpler than the way I was thinking of it, it couldn't have supported polyphony anyway so the idea of creating a singular argument for each note was inefficient to begin with. This way, there's no favouritism over which statement came first. Additionally, I included the light level mapping from the Guitar project but changed a few things to keep it the simplest. Instead of multiplying the light level (0 - 255) by 1.02743 to get 262 (the same pitch as C 4, Note 1) I mapped the input values to 0 - 1. Mathematically, simply dividing light level by light level (255). Then per note basis, ringing the tone (original note + (Variable Light * original note)) to achieve a pitch modulation range of 1 octave per note. The actual value that the variable light multiplies by differs slightly from the original note in keeping with the standard equal-tempered tuning system.*


## "Kind-A-Works" Piano ##


### Project description ###

This project is designed to be a completely portable, wireless musical instrument for impromptu jams by yourself or with friends. It has a five-note layout and is tuned to a 'C' pentatonic scale with revived analogue character and fuzz. Light permitting, you can take advantage of the on-board pitch modulation using the sliding tab on the left side of the housing. In bright light, the pitches are an octave higher than in low light. The sliding tab allows for the pitch to smoothly glissando down to the lower octave.

### Reflection ###

In terms of my original goals I believe that I was somewhat successful. I got the general idea of the expansions I wanted to make across and I believe it works "kind of" well as a cohesive unit on its own. However, I know that there is plenty of room for improvement in all areas. As far as improvement of physical outcome, I think that the base interactions work as is and only require more precise and sturdier manufacturing for refinement. Refining and improving on the musical outcome would greatly improve the ultimate success of the product for me. This was a result of a lack of conceptual knowledge as to how the microbit code understood and wrote language. I had a preconceived idea as how to get to what I wanted and that greatly limited how I was able problem solve the issues I came across. I think that if I rethought about how the microbit understands things and what physical pins it is limited by I could reengineer a far better outcome with potentially no changes to the conceptual model. Additionally, due to my lack of comprehensive understanding of the coding language and microcontroller, areas of the design that would've improved feedback and user experience were eventually tossed out. For example, I had thought that while a speaker that plays the note pressed is an immediate form of feedback, if a speaker wire came loose (which was often) the user would then receive no feedback at all that the depression of the key was doing anything and would cause a negative emotive response (my roommate confirmed this hypothesis of mine). So, I thought of connecting LEDs into the system so that the user would be given visual feedback as, if nothing else, a backup response to the speaker wires coming loose. However, the testing I performed including multiple LEDs and keys taking up separate pins resulted in errors that were due to the pin assignments in microbit. It is only after completing some other stages of testing and research did I find that I probably could've still used LEDs, just thought a little more laterally about how to efficiently use the pins that were the most effective. It was because I had a different conceptual model of how the i/o and code worked that I gave up on some features. 
This point ties into another area of improvement to be made: process. I feel that the process I chose to adopt meant that didn't keep focus on the problem but more of the solution. While this may sound like a fine process (I thought so too) I realised in the late stages of manufacturing that I was so fixed on the idea of making a completely DIY "Nintendo Labo" style piano that I forgot about how I was going to get there technically and what the problem originally was. For me, the banana piano lacked versatility in its functionality. There was no control over what type of sound played, how long, how loud, what pitch etc. In focussing on the idea of a cardboard keyboard I neglected those issues and made a less versatile product. 

But the good news is that it means there is room for improvement!


I really wished that I had taken more of the advice and lessons from reading about Sullivan's work and implemented them here. His earnest but slightly haphazard methods for prototyping gave me plenty of inspiration and guidance whilst reading them, but I feel as though I didn't follow through on many of his points when it came to reality. Especially when it came to google and friends. I didn't seek help enough throughout the times when I needed to because I felt that I needed to find the solution myself otherwise I wouldn't learn anything. When it comes to troubleshooting and especially temperamental electronics, it is infinitely wiser to seek a human in person than google because while google may be right sometime, your friend can at least share your frustration and you can problem solve it together. 


The Nintendo Labo was incredible to me when it first came out, the concept as well as the seemingly magical workings of it all drew me in. I looked into how they made everything work with two little controllers and some reflective stickers and was in awe. I would say that the Labo was the most influential idea for my project. As said previously, I've completed an interactive project prior to this which informed much of how I thought about code, building and design. While that project was more heavily centred around the musicality outcomes, I took a lot of real world and conceptual knowledge and philosophy away from the experience. More specifically, we worked by programming with Pure Data (https://puredata.info/) which is open source software that is favoured for building sound design from the ground up and university students. It is an entirely visual means of programming but far more conceptually open than makecode for microbit. While it is freeing to use such versatile programming, makecode varies widely from Pd to the point that I had to adjust my means of thinking for it to make sense, but nonetheless I was heavily informed by what I learned in Pd.


An interesting expansion would be to make the simplistic model into a large scale interactive piece for multiple people to get involved with. In which, each member of this 'orchestra' has their own small piece of a giant synthesiser. Say that one person had an oscillator tone as a "note" or "block" and another had a modifying "block" that could change the pitch or timbre of the oscillator. Allowing for collaboration and mischief all in one interactive synthesiser. In this context, the instrument is being broken down into functional components that teach through experimentation how a synthesiser works and some basic sonic and electronic principles.
