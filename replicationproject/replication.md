This product serves as the inspiration for the aesthetics as well as some parts of the functional design such as the key and slider mechanics. However, due some material and process restrictions, the original mechanics had to be adapted to be suitable for use with the microbit. 

## Reading reflections ##
*Reflective reading is an important part of actually making your reading worthwhile. Don't just read the words to understand what they say: read to see how the ideas in the text fit with and potentially change your existing knowledge and maybe even conceptual frameworks. We assume you can basically figure out what the readings mean, but the more important process is to understand how that changes what you think, particularly in the context of your project.*

*For each of the assigned readings, answer the questions below.*

### Reading: Don Norman, The Design of Everyday Things, Chapter 1 (The Psychopathology of Everyday Things) ###

I had previously thought that signifiers and affordances were the same in many cases. Whilst reading I realised that I had thought that conceptual models weren't as important as they are for successful discoverability. 

In reading, I learned about how to go about analysing design in a much more profound sense; looking at the intertwining concepts that cause myself great annoyance or satisfaction in my daily life. Further, in analysing the world around my interations I began to see how designs could be improved for the sake of a user. Having made some interactive projects in the past, I found that I could see it from more of a technical angle about why it was successful in some areas and lacking in others. I found the challenge of "redesigning" a project in a new and interesting light from this and implemented the same concepts and analysis to the creation process. 

Personally, after reading this excerpt I felt even more interested by feedback systems. Especially non-verbal feedback systems. Having a background in music technology, I often compared the designs of electronic instruments, synthesizers, controllers and acoustic instruments like the clarinet or cello. The relationship between instrument and player is heavily dependant on the communications between them and when it comes to sound, much is communicated through haptic feedback. This being kinesthetic communication predominately felt as vibration. The player parses these vibrations as a response based on an inital command. The instrument communicates back to you which creates an intelligible relationship unique to each instrument and player.

As stated previously, this particular reading profoundly influenced the creation process in all stages. As I went through the original makecode banana piano project I felt that it could be improved utilising the principles Normal taught. When it came to design, a traditional piano layout seemed both the most appropriate and already laden with understanding of the conceptual model: press key --> sound plays, pitch increases left to right in keys. Using the design of the Nintedo Labo meant that I could keep the same and expected gesture of the note becoming depressed once pressed, even if it did nothing functionally. It served to allow the user to understand that their inherent expectation was not to be subverted and thus avoid a negative emotive response to that cognitive subversion. I applied this thought processes to the solutions I had to engineer throughout the physical and code based manufactoring stages as well.

### Reading: Chapter 1 of Dan Saffer, Microinteractions: Designing with Details, Chapter 1 ###

I previously thought not about microinteractions in this particular way but more in terms of their role in the larger elements. I also never thought of them with such definition as Saffer describes.

Saffer completely adjusted my philosophy towards design and products. I can now better communicate my analyses of the world around me and, similar to Norman, more accurately dissect stimulus. I especially found his thoughts on the mentalities you can take with microinteractions eye-opening. For instance, unrelatedly I read a paper on the invention of the Walkman. In it, the author claims that its invention was, "a regressive product of invention..." But, looking at how Saffer argues about microinteractions, it is clear that while the Walkman does functionally have fewer features than the boombox at the time, it focussed on a single feature and redesigned a product around a microinteraction. Here, the Walkman's simplistic focus on a sole interaction is what led to massive success. I've found that the design of such, and further expansion, integrates all of Saffer's philosophical principles. 

As I have an interest in holistic philosophy I found his thoughts on methodology interesting. Particularly his thought about ensuring that your product is a harmonious working of microinteractions. This is the type of mentality that I wish to adopt into my creative processes. Of which I began with the replication project. 

Applying the methodology and terminology to this project was profoundly useful in testing the concept model as a cohesive whole. When drawing up what could be interacted with, to what result and design, I frequenctly broke down the product as a whole to view the individual microinteractions then brought it back together to feel out how harmonious the integration was. If nothing else, it was a fantastic exerice in careful and deliberate design choices. 

### Reading: Scott Sullivan, Prototyping Interactive Objects ###

I found through reading that I had always assumed that getting to a pitchable prototyle was for professionals alone and that every iteration was only a proof of concept and material test, nothing more. 

Throughout the reading I realised that while the possibilities are "endless" for solutions to needs and goals, the solution you come to is only hindered by what you conceptually know exists as a designer. Which is why Sullivan doesn't specifically state what subsidary skills/knowledge a prototyping designer should look into. Everthing could be useful and will influence how you approach a problem, or even the means of function to a solution. Even so, if a designer comes up with a solution that they don't know the means to, google and friends are fantastic enlighteners.

This reading reignited my interest in project creation for the sake of it. I previously made an interactive electronic music controller/instrument and had a very similar experience to Sullivan. Not knowing anything about circuitry or electronics except that water may or may not be a wise decision. I found the experience challenging but also exhilarating because the design was my own and I could decide how far I wanted to reach into the realm of polished product. While that project was 'forced' upon me, I feel as though forcing myself into a problem to reach a satisfying solution is, as Sullivan learned, an excellent way to feel great about small victories and learn experiencially about everything surrounding the problem. 

There were many times during the production of my project where something went very differently to what was expected or just refused to work at all. During those times, I learned about the wonderful world of troubleshooting, an important step/s of the prototyping process.


## Interaction flowchart ##
*Draw a flowchart of the interaction process in your project. Make sure you think about all the stages of interaction step-by-step. Also make sure that you consider actions a user might take that aren't what you intend in an ideal use case. Insert an image of it below. It might just be a photo of a hand-drawn sketch, not a carefully drawn digital diagram. It just needs to be legible.*

## Process documentation

*In this section, include text and images that represent the development of your project including sources you've found (URLs and written references), choices you've made, sketches you've done, iterations completed, materials you've investigated, and code samples. Use the markdown reference for help in formatting the material.*

*This should have quite a lot of information!*

*There will likely by a dozen or so images of the project under construction. The images should help explain why you've made the choices you've made as well as what you have done. Use the code below to include images, and copy it for each image, updating the information for each.*

*Include screenshots of the code you have used.*

## Project outcome ##

*Complete the following information.*

### Project title ###

### Project description ###

*In a few sentences, describe what the project is and does, who it is for, and a typical use case.*

### Showcase image ###

*Try to capture the image as if it were in a portfolio, sales material, or project proposal. The project isn't likely to be something that finished, but practice making images that capture the project in that style.*

### Reflection ###

*Describe the parts of your project you felt were most successful and the parts that could have done with improvement, whether in terms of outcome, process, or understanding.*


*What techniques, approaches, skills, or information did you find useful from other sources (such as the related projects you identified earlier)?*


*What ideas have you read, heard, or seen that informed your thinking on this project? (Provide references.)*


*What might be an interesting extension of this project? In what other contexts might this project be used?*
